1. Project Kickoff
•	Specific Goals: The main goal of my project is to build an e-commerce data warehouse, which includes two modules: data collection and data storage. This involves setting up frameworks like Hadoop, Hive, Spark, MySQL, and others to handle the entire data flow and storage process.
•	Project Scope: To avoid scope creep, I will define my project around these core deliverables: data collection (using tools like Kafka, Flume) and data storage (using MySQL, Hive). I’ll ensure that only necessary technologies are included for these functions.
•	Deliverables:
o	Phase 1: Set up the data collection module (Flume, Kafka).
o	Phase 2: Data storage and querying module (Hive, MySQL).
o	Phase 3: Integrate the modules and test data flow.
•	Major Milestones:
o	Complete setup of the data collection module.
o	Database and storage module readiness.
o	Integration and testing of the full system.
•	Capabilities & Gaps: While I have experience with many tools, I still need to fill some knowledge gaps for DolphinScheduler, Kafka, and Flume.
•	Dataset: Since I don’t have a dataset ready, I plan to generate synthetic data or use publicly available datasets for testing.
2. Team Discussions
•	Core Skills: Since I’m the sole person working on this project, I will be responsible for all tasks. I am proficient in Java, ZooKeeper, MySQL, Hive, and have some knowledge of Hadoop and Spark.
•	Missing Skills: I still need to learn DolphinScheduler, Kafka, and Flume, which could cause delays if not addressed early.
•	Tools: I have experience with most of the tools but will need to invest time to learn more about DolphinScheduler and Kafka for distributed scheduling and message brokering.
3. Skills & Tools Assessment
•	External Resources: I may use online tutorials or seek out forums to quickly learn the gaps in my knowledge, particularly for Kafka and DolphinScheduler.
•	Tools Suitability: The tools and frameworks I have chosen—Hadoop, Hive, Spark, MySQL—are suitable for my project’s scope. DolphinScheduler and Kafka will be important once I am comfortable using them.
•	Comfort Level: I will ensure that I am comfortable with the tools by dedicating time to practicing and experimenting with them before starting the project.
4. Initial Setup
•	Development Environment: I will set up a Java-based environment with Hadoop, Hive, Spark, MySQL, Kafka, Flume, ZooKeeper, and DolphinScheduler. Docker or virtual machines will help me simulate a production environment.
•	Version Control: I plan to use Git for version control and ensure that everything is tracked, especially configuration files.
•	Software & Libraries: I will install and configure the required libraries for Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Flume, and DolphinScheduler.
•	Testing: I’ll start with basic unit tests to ensure each framework works properly—ensuring Hadoop processes data, Hive runs queries, and Kafka handles message transmission correctly.
•	Troubleshooting: For any setup issues, I will refer to the documentation and log files, especially for Hadoop and Spark, which are often useful for diagnosing errors.
5. Progress Review
•	What has been achieved so far?
At this point, I haven’t started any of the tasks. The initial setup, repository configuration, and other preparatory work are still pending.
•	Have there been any issues or blockers?
The main blockers are my current knowledge gaps in DolphinScheduler, Kafka, and Flume. Additionally, I don’t yet have a dataset, which could delay testing phases.
•	Is everyone contributing as expected?
Since I am the only team member, I will need to allocate my time more efficiently to ensure progress. I haven’t yet begun, so contribution hasn’t started.
•	Are we on track with the timeline and milestones?
Given that I haven’t started, I am currently behind schedule. I will need to reassess the timeline to account for the learning curve for unfamiliar tools.
•	How does the progress align with the project’s overall objectives?
Since no progress has been made, I’m not yet aligned with the project’s overall objectives. The focus needs to be on starting the initial setup and addressing any blockers as soon as possible.
6. Plan Revision
•	Do we need to adjust the project timeline or milestones?
Yes, the timeline will need adjustments. I need to allocate more time for learning DolphinScheduler, Kafka, and Flume before moving forward with the project.
•	Are any tasks delayed or requiring reassignment?
Since I am working alone, reassignment is not an option. However, I need to prioritize learning the necessary tools before starting the technical setup.
•	How can we ensure clarity on the revised plan?
I will create a revised plan with clear learning objectives, deadlines for the initial setup, and testing milestones. Regular progress reviews will help keep things on track.
•	What communication strategies can be implemented?
I can create a more structured work schedule and document my progress daily. Regular self-assessments and tracking tools (such as a project management board) will help avoid delays.
•	How will I track progress going forward?
I’ll use a project management tool (such as Trello or Jira) to break down the work into smaller tasks and track progress. Each task will have a deadline, and I’ll update the tool daily to maintain alignment with the revised plan.
